# Titanic
Log Reg+SVM to predict survival classes
Titanic comp on Kaggle is a great to begin with on Kaggle. However it has a bunch of ways to solve it and to improve your score. With this notebook I've gained 0.77511 - max with SVM model (kernel=poly). I've tried my own version of recoding continuous variables in categorical ones, however it didn't bring me higher score. I'll continue to work on Titanic one day. But that is for now.
