# Titanic
Logistic Regression+SVM were used to predict survival classes in Titanic comp on Kaggle. This comp is  good to begin with on Kaggle. However, there is a bunch of ways to solve it and to improve the score. With this notebook I've gained 0.77511 - max with SVM model (kernel=poly). I've tried my own version of recoding continuous variables in categorical ones, however it didn't bring me a higher score. I'll continue to work on this project.
